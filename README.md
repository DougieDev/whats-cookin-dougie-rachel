# __What's Cookin'?__

What's Cookin' is a cooking/meal planning application, allowing users the ability to save a recipe or recipes of their choosing to a list of 'Favorites' or 'Recipes To Cook' for later viewing. Recipes can also be sorted by the category they fall under (breakfast, side dish, dessert, etc.). Finally, if a user decides to cook a saved recipe and does not have all of the required ingredients in their pantry, the app will provide a grocery list of the missing ingredients as well as the estimated cost associated with them.
